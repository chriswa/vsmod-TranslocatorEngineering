# vsmod-TranslocatorEngineering

This mod enables the deconstruction, construction, and linking of Static Translocators. To get started, you will need 3 steel ingots, 2 gold ingots, 1 rough diamond, and at least 1 sacrificial Static Translocator.

## The Crowbar

The crowbar can be smithed on an anvil, using a single steel ingot. It can only be made of steel. With the crowbar in hand, hold Sneak (shift) and right click to pry a Static Translocator apart.

## Breaking Apart Translocators

Crowbars are not an exact science. Some components are lost when using the crowbar:

- 1x Gate Array (80% chance of recovery)
- 1x Particulation Component (80% chance of recovery)
- 1x Power Core (always recovered)
- 1x Glass Slab (always recovered)
- 4x Metal Parts (2-4 recovered)
- 1x Coalescence Crystal (5-6 shards recovered, 6 shards are required to make a complete crystal)

If you previously repaired the Translocator, you will also get back the 2 Metal Parts and any Temporal Gears you added. (However, if a Translocator was repaired with Temporal Gears by a non-Clockmaker before this mod was added, 1 fewer gears will be returned.)

If you crafted the Translocator, you will get back the extra 2 Metal Parts and 2 Temporal Gears you used in crafting it.

## Using the Linker

The Linker can be used to connect crafted or found Translocators.

There's no point in building and placing newly crafted Translocators without a Linker, because they won't go anywhere. Only the Translocators found in ruined structures are pre-linked to other Translocators.

The Linker crafting recipe includes a Gate Array (among other things, check the Handbook,) so at least one Translocator must be pried apart to craft it.

To use the Linker, right click on a Translocator, then right click it on a second Translocator. Both Translocators will become linked. If either Translocator was previously linked to another Translocator, those other Translocator(s) will become unlinked. All Translocation is two-way: there are never one-way Translocators.

The maximum distance a link can be made between two Translocators with the Linker is 8000 blocks. The lights on the front of the Linker provide a rough indicator of distance. As you travel away from the first Translocator you've synchronized the linker to, the lights will go out (1 light every 1000 blocks.) If you are holding a Linker which is synchronized to a Translocator which is farther away than 8000 blocks, all lights will go out and the panel will flicker, indicating that you are out of range.

After synchronizing your linker to a Translocator, you can reset it by holding Sneak (shift) and right clicking. Be careful: this cannot be undone!

## New Translocators

Craft them and place them wherever you like. The recipe is in the handbook.

Crafted Translocators are fully repaired and ready to be linked: you will not need to add additional Metal Parts or additional Temporal Gears.

They won't do anything until they are linked with the Linker.
